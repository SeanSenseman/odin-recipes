        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Homemade Chicken and Waffles is a true soul food brunch dish that everyone loves. My recipe includes juicy Southern fried chicken and fluffy waffles with an amazing sweet and spicy sauce made with maple syrup or honey.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> 8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs </li>
                <li> Vegetable Oil, for deep frying </li>
                <li> 2 cups (480 mL) buttermilk OR soured whole milk* (see notes) </li>
                <li> tablespoon kosher salt</li>
                <li> ½ tablespoon garlic powder</li>
                <li> ½ tablespoon onion powder</li>
                <li> 1 tablespoon hot sauce or chili powder</li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon smoked paprika </li>
                <li> 3 cups (384 g) all-purpose flour </li>
                <li> ⅓ cup (43 g) cornstarch </li>
                <li> 2 teaspoon baking powder </li>
                <li> 2 teaspoon garlic powder </li>
                <li> 2 teaspoon onion powder </li>
                <li> 2 teaspoon kosher salt </li>
                <li> 2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper </li>
                <li> ¼ cup (85 g) honey (you can sub maple syrup) </li>
                <li> ½ teaspoon chili powder (or more if you like a lot of spice) </li>
                <li> 4 tablespoon (57 g) unsalted butter </li>
                <li> ½ teaspoon kosher salt </li>   
            </ul>    
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk the buttermilk or soured milk, kosher salt, garlic powder, onion powder, hot sauce, and smoked paprika together in a large mixing bowl. </li>
                <li>Add the boneless, skinless chicken thigh to the bowl, making sure every thigh is covered in the brine. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the chicken marinate in the buttermilk brine from 1 hour to overnight in the fridge. </li>
                <li>In a dutch oven pot, heat up about half the pot's worth of vegetable oil. Allow the oil to reach 350 degrees F (180 degrees C/ 160 degrees C if using a fan-forced oven). </li>
                <li>While the oil is heating up, in a mixing bowl whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and seasonings. Take each chicken thigh from the brine and dredge into the seasoned flour. Thoroughly coat the chicken all over, then let rest on a plate for five minutes before frying.</li>
                <li>Fry the chicken in the hot oil (no more than about 4 thighs per batch) until golden brown, crispy, and cooked through completely, about 8-9 minutes. </li>
                <li>Carefully take the chicken out of the oil and place them on a baking sheet fitted with a wire rack and let cool slightly before serving. Repeat until all the chicken thighs are fried.</li>
                <li>Bake until brown and crisp on the bottom, about 15 minutes, then flip and cook until the other side is crisp, about 10 minutes. Serve hot.</li>
            </ol>
